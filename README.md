Rule2
=========

-----

CRUD to ease the data entry pain of incident-reporting for local sherrif's office.

Aims for reducing the number of fields and duplication of effort required to report an incident with the following strategies:

1] Remove any field from the form that a machine can auto-populate

2] Sensible geolocation defaults (city and zipcode fields are interdepent)

3] Single-sign on via LDAP for enterprise

4] reduce duplication of effort via ETL

5] auto validate complex form

6] typeahead searching for offense form

7] PDF transcription
